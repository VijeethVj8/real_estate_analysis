## üîé Analysis Workflow  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Fixed datatypes (zip codes as strings, dates as datetime)  
- Handled missing values  
- Removed outliers (e.g., price > $10M, 400+ bedrooms)  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics for numeric & categorical fields  
- Missing value heatmaps and distributions  

### 3. Geographic Insights  
- **State-level medians** (price, beds, baths, size, lot size)  
- **City-level analysis** with $/sqft comparisons  
- Identified undervalued and overvalued markets  

### 4. Time-Series Trends  
- National & state-level **median price trends**  
- **Monthly rolling medians** for seasonality  
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rates**  
- Heatmap of **state √ó year growth**  
- Volatility analysis (Top/Bottom states by YoY growth)  

### 5. Visualizations  
- Bar charts: top states/cities by median price  
- Dual-axis plots: price vs size vs lot size  
- Line charts: national & state price trends  
- Heatmap: YoY growth by state  
- Volatility lines: most boom/bust states vs U.S. baseline
